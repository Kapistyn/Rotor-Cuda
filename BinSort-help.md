## For Linux
- Open BinSort Folder
  
  ```sh

    $ cd BinSort 

    $ sudo apt install -y libgmp-dev
    
    $ make

    ```
- Add ' hash160_out.bin ' ( generated by addresses_to_hash160.py ) for sorting*
  
  ```sh
 
    $ ./BinSort 20 hash160_out.bin h160_sorted.bin
    
    ```
- Now move the ' h160_sorted.bin ' to Linux folder

 ## For Windows
 
 - Use Python: ```python addresses_to_hash160.py addresses.txt hax160.bin```

- if there is no python Windows: ```b58dec.exe addresses.txt hex160.bin```

- Next, you need to sort the base hex160.bin

- CMD: ```BinSort.exe 20 hex160.bin hex160sorted.bin```

- Or another program CMD: ```RMD160-Sort.exe hex160.bin hex160sorted.bin```

- For the test, you can use a ready-made base [puzzle_1_37_hash160_out_sorted.bin](https://github.com/phrutis/Rotor-Cuda/blob/main/Others/puzzle_1_37_hash160_out_sorted.bin)

## How to create a base of Ethereum addresses 

- Downloading the fresh database of ethereum addresses [here](https://blockchair.com/dumps)

- Use Python: ```python eth_addresses_to_bin.py eth_addresses_in.txt eth_addresses_out.bin```

- Next, you need to sort the base eth_addresses_out.bin

- CMD: ```BinSort.exe 20 eth_addresses_out.bin eth_addresses_sotrted.bin```

- Or another program CMD: ```RMD160-Sort.exe eth_addresses_out.bin eth_addresses_sorted.bin```

- For the test, you can use a ready-made base [puzzle_1_37_addresses_eth_sorted.bin](https://github.com/phrutis/Rotor-Cuda/blob/main/Others/puzzle_1_37_addresses_eth_sorted.bin)

## How to create a base of Public keys for Multi X Points mode

- Downloading the fresh database of addresses [here](https://blockchair.com/dumps)

- We take Legacy addresses starting with 1xxx... from the base and create a list addresses.txt

- Use Python: ```Pub-from-blockchain.py``` (addresses.txt file is created pubkeys.txt) (speed limit 50 address in 60 sek)

- Or manually use the link [https://blockchain.info/q/pubkeyaddr/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ](https://blockchain.info/q/pubkeyaddr/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ)

- Since the search is compressed, public keys starting with 02 and 03 are suitable for it. 

- You can use public keys from Uncompressed addresses 04 (128 characters). The script converts them to a compressed format.

- If the program finds such a public key, it will give a compressed address. Using the found private key, generate a positive uncompressed address

- Convert public keys (02,03,04) use Python: ```python pubkeys_to_xpoint.py pubkeys_in.txt xpoints_out.bin```

- Make sure to sort the base CMD: ```BinSort.exe 32 xpoints_out.bin Xpoints_Sorted.bin```
